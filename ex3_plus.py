# 3. Find something you need to calculate and write a new .py file that does it.
# try to use python to validate one calculation, but it just connot calculate 
# ".^", element wise calculation. well, drop it here. and waite for further.

# A=[38946,43420,49191,50430,50557,52580,53595,54135,60181,62076]
# std_A = sqrt ( 1/(len(A)-1) * SUM((A - mean(A)).^2 ))
# print std_A
